   abstract = {To study coisotropic reduction in the context of deformation quantization we introduce constraint manifolds and constraint algebras as the basic objects encoding the additional information needed to define a reduction. General properties of various categories of constraint objects and their compatiblity with reduction are examined. A constraint Serre-Swan theorem, identifying constraint vector bundles with certain finitely generated projective constraint modules, as well as a constraint symbol calculus are proved. After developing the general deformation theory of constraint algebras, including constraint Hochschild cohomology and constraint differential graded Lie algebras, the second constraint Hochschild cohomology for the constraint algebra of functions on a constraint flat space is computed.},
